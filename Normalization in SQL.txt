what is normilization?
      processes of reducing the redudancy of data.
      Imporves the data Integrity



Data Anomalies:
      1. Insertion
      2. Updation
      3. Deletion

Types of Normal forms:
      1. 1st Normal form(1NF):        
            - Removes repeating groups from the table
            - Create a separate table for each set of related data
            - Identify each set of related data with a primary key


      2. 2nd normal form(2NF):
            - It has to be in 1st Normal form.
            - Table also should not contain partial dependency.

      3. 3rd normal form(3NF):
            - It has to be in 2nd Normal form.
            - There should be no transitive dependency for non-prime attributs.

      4. Boyce codd normal form(BCNF):
            - It has to be in 3rd normal form
            - Higher version 3NF and was developed by Raymond F. Boyce and Edgar F. codd
            - Every functional dependency A -> B, then A has to be the super key of that particular table.
