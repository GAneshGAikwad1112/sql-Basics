SELECT QUERY: 

      Most basic query used to manipulate a database is SELECT query

      syntax:     
            Select * from student;  #displaying all the column from the table
            Select fname, lname from student;  #for displaying perticular column



WHERE QUERY: 
      If we need only certain records from the table.
      where clause acts as a filtering mechanism.

      syntax:
            SELECT
            column1, column2,.....column N
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition;

            example: 

            SELECT FName
            FROM student
            WHERE City = 'Goa';


AND, OR and NOT statements:

      AND operator: 
                  This operator displyes a records if all the condition separated by AND or TRUE

            syntax: AND operator

                  SELECT column1,column2,...... column N
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition 1 AND condition 2;

            example:
                  SELECT * FROM student
                  WHERE FName = 'John' AND LName = 'Deo';

      OR operator: 
                  This operator displyes a records if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE

                  
            syntax: OR operator

                  SELECT column1,column2,...... column N
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition 1 OR condition 2;

            example:
                  SELECT * FROM student
                  WHERE FName = 'John' OR LName = 'Deo';
      
      NOT operator:
                  This operator displays a records if the condition are NOT TRUE

            syntax: NOT operator

                  SELECT column1,column2,...... column N
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE NOT condition 2;

            example:
                  SELECT * FROM student
                  WHERE NOT LName = 'Deo';

INSERT INTO query:
      If we want ot insert any new record or data into a table then we can use the INSERT query

      syntax: 
            INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2,... columnN)
            VALUES (value1, value2, value3,.....)

      Example:
            INSERT INTO Student(studentID, FName, LName, Address
            , City, Marks)
            VALUES( 101, 'JHON', DOE', '#21, MG Road', 'Bengaluru', 550)

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS:
      - COUNT
            This is a function returns the number of rows that match specified criteria.

            syntax: 
                  COUNT (column_name)
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition;

            example:
                  SELECT COUNT(studentID)
                  FROM Student;

      - AVERAGE
            This function returns the average value of a numeric column.

            syntax: 
                  SELECT AVG (column_name)
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition;

            example:
                  SELECT AVG(Marks)
                  FROM Student;
      
      - SUM
            This function returns the total sum of the numeric column.

            syntax: 
                  SELECT SUM (column_name)
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition;

            example:
                  SELECT SUM(Marks)
                  FROM Student;

      - MIN
            This function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

            syntax: 
                  SELECT MIN (column_name)
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition;

            example:
                  SELECT fname, lname,  MIN(Marks)
                  FROM Student;
      
      - MIX
            This function returns the largest value of the selected column.

            syntax: 
                  SELECT MIX (column_name)
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition;

            example:
                  SELECT fname, lname,  MIX(Marks)
                  FROM Student;

      - GROUP BY
            Used in SQL to arrange idential data into groups with the help of some functions.

            syntax: 
                  SELECT column_name(s)
                  FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition
                  GROUP BY column_name(s);

            example:
                  SELECT COUNT(studentID),City
                  FROM Student
                  GROUP BY City;


      - DELETE
            The SQL DELETE command is used to delete rows that are no longer required from the database tables.

            syntax:
                  DELETE FROM table_name
                  WHERE condition;

            example:
                  SELECT * FROM student;
                  DELETE FROM student
                  WHERE City = 'Mumbai';
