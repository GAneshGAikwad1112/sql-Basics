Comparison Operational:
      
      NOT IN

            example:

                  SQL> select dept_name, loc from dept where loc not in ('chennai','bangalore')

            Output:
                  dept_name         loc
                  HR                Hyderabad

      
      IN
            fetches values from a set of literals. It is used to test whether or not a value is "in" the list of 
            values provided after the keyword IN. The IN condition can be used with any data type in SQL.

            This condition is generally used when we want to check/fetch values from multiple values in single statement.

            example:
                  SQL> select first_name, deptno from employee where job_id in('J1','J2');

            Output:
                  first_name     deptno
                  Smith             10
